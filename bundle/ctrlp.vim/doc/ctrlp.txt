  1 - in a new tab
  2 - in a new horizontal split
  3 - in a new vertical split
  0 - in the current window/split
>
  let g:ctrlp_split_window = 0
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_ignore_space'*

When starting up the prompt, automatically set the working directory (i.e. the
|current-directory|) to:
  1 - the parent directory of the current file.
  2 - the nearest ancestor that contains one of these directories/files:
      .git/
      .hg/
      .bzr/
      _darcs/
      root.dir
      .vimprojects
  0 - don’t manage working directory.
>
  let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 1
<
You can use this functionality outside of |CtrlP| by adding the following line
to your |.vimrc|; the parameter is the same (1, 2 and 0): >
  au BufEnter * cal ctrlp#SetWorkingPath(2)
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_root_markers'*

  let g:ctrlp_max_height = 10
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_use_caching'*
Set this to 0 to disable per-session caching. When disabled, caching will still
be enabled for directories that have more than 4000 files: >
  let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 1
<
Note: you can quickly purge the cache by pressing <F5>.

                                                *'g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit'*
Set this to 0 to enable cross-sessions caching by not deleting the caches upon
exit: >
  let g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 1
<

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_cache_dir'*

Use this to customize the mappings inside |CtrlP|’s prompt to your liking. You
only need to keep the lines that you’ve changed the values (inside []): >
  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {
    \ 'PrtBS()':                    ['<bs>'],

    \ 'ToggleType(-1)':             ['<c-b>', '<c-down>'],
    \ 'PrtCurStart()':              ['<c-a>'],
    \ 'PrtCurEnd()':                ['<c-e>'],
    \ 'PrtCurLeft()':               ['<c-h>', '<left>'],

Set this to 0 to completely disable the Most Recently Used files feature: >
  let g:ctrlp_mru_files = 1
<

                                                           *'g:ctrlp_mruf_max'*
Specify the number of recently opened files you want |CtrlP| to remember: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_max = 50
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude'*
Files you don’t want |CtrlP| to remember; use |regexp| to specify the patterns:
>
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = '/tmp/.*\|/temp/.*' " MacOSX/Linux
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude = '^C:\\dev\\tmp\\.*' " Windows
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_mruf_include'*
And if you want |CtrlP| to only remember some files, specify them here: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_include = ''
<
Example: >
  let g:ctrlp_mruf_include = '\.py$\|\.rb$'
<

                                                           *'g:ctrlp_dotfiles'*
Set this to 0 if you don’t want |CtrlP| to search for dotfiles and dotdirs: >
  let g:ctrlp_dotfiles = 1
<
You can also use |'wildignore'| to exclude anything from the search.
e.g. exclude version control directories from the results: >
  set wildignore+=.git/*,.hg/*,.svn/*  " Linux/MacOSX
  set wildignore+=.git\*,.hg\*,.svn\*  " Windows
<

                                                    *'g:ctrlp_highlight_match'*
Use this to enable/disable highlighting of the matched patterns and to specify
the highlight group that’ll be used: >
  let g:ctrlp_highlight_match = [1, 'Function']
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_user_command'*
Specify an external tool to use for indexing files instead of Vim’s globpath().
Use %s in place of the target directory: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'       " MacOSX/Linux
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d' " Windows
<

You can also use 'grep', 'findstr' or something else to filter the results.
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f | grep (?!tmp/.*)'
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d | findstr .*\.py$'
<

4. Mappings                                                    *ctrlp-mappings*

                                                                *'ctrlp-<c-p>'*
<c-p>
   Default |Normal| mode mapping to open the |CtrlP| prompt.

Once inside the prompt:

  <c-r>                                                    *'ctrlp-fullregexp'*
    Toggle between the smart |regexp|/string mode (section 5.b) and full

    See also |input-formats| and |g:ctrlp_regexp_search|.

  <c-d>
    Toggle between full path search and filename only search.
    (note: in filename mode, the prompt’s base is '>d>' instead of '>>>')

  <c-f>, 'forward'
  <c-up>
    Toggle between searching files and searching buffers. Or switch to the
    'next' search type in the sequence; currently files, buffers and most
    recently used files (MRU Files) are available.

  <c-b>, 'backward'
  <c-down>
    Toggle between searching files and searching buffers. Or switch to the
    'previous' search type in the sequence.

  <tab>
    Toggle the focus between the match window and the prompt.

  <c-n>,
  <c-j>,
  <down>
    Move selection down

  <c-p>,
  <c-k>,
  <up>
    Move selection up

  <right>
    Move the cursor one character to the 'right'

  <c-w>
    Delete a preceding inner word

  <c-u>
    Clear the input field

  <cr>
    Open selected file with the method specified with |g:ctrlp_split_window|

  <c-t>
    Open selected file in a new 'tab'

  <c-v>
    Open selected file in a 'vertical' split

  <c-cr>,
  <c-s>
    Open selected file in a 'horizontal' split

  <F5>
    Refresh the match window and purge the cache for the current directory.

  <esc>,
  <c-c>,
  <c-g>
    Exit |CtrlP|

Chose your own mappings with |g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings|.

When inside the match window (press <tab> to switch to):

  a-z
  0-9
  ~^-=;`',.+!@#$%&_(){}[]
    Cycle through the lines with the first letter (paths or filenames) that
    match that character.

===============================================================================
5. Input Formats                                          *ctrlp-input-formats*

                                                   *ctrlp-prompt-input-formats*
Formats for inputting in the prompt:

a)  Simple string. e.g. 'abc' is understood internally as 'a.\{-}b.\{-}c'

b)  Vim |regexp|. If the input string contains '*', '^', '$', '+' or '$', it’ll
    be treated as a Vim’s |regexp| |pattern| without any modification.
    e.g. 'abc\d*efg' will be read as 'abc\d*efg'.

    See also |ctrlp-fullregexp| and |g:ctrlp_regexp_search|.

c)  Strings end with a colon ':' followed by an arbitrary number will be read
    as a line number to jump to after opening the file.
    e.g. 'abc:45' will open the selected file and jump to line 45.

d)  Type exactly two dots (..) at the start of the line and press enter to go
    backward in the directory tree by 1 level. If the parent directory is
    large, this might be slow.

6. Credits                                                      *ctrlp-credits*

Developed by Kien Nguyen (github.com/kien), based on the Command-T and the
LustyExplorer plugins. No code was taken from these plugins, but I did clone
the majority of their (awesome) interfaces and the way they work.

This was originally written as a module for a would-be larger plugin called
AutoDoc.vim which I’ve stopped developing because of lost of interest. I really
liked the way Command-T and LustyExplorer deal with user’s input, so I wrote a
pure Vimscript version of their prompt window, intended to use it for the
aforementioned plugin.
